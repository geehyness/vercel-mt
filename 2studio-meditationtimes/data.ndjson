In Genesis 6:8 (KJV) we read; 'But Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord'. This is wonderful! When grace locates you, your life will be preserved. Noah and his family were preserved because grace located him. The same grace that found Noah, found Moses, David and the Israeli nation. Take note, in the case of Noah, just as it was with Moses, David and the Israelites, it was God who extended His grace to him, rather than him locating grace. Hallelujah! May this be your testimony as well.\nWhen speaking to God, Moses placed emphasis on grace. In Exodus 33:15-17 (KJV) Moses said; 'If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence. For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? is it not in that thou goest with us? so shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. And the Lord said unto Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name.' Waal! Moses understood the value of God's grace. He knew that grace distinguished God's people from the rest of mankind. By reason of grace, the Israelis have been preserved despite being surrounded by many enemies. May grace distinguish you from those who surround you.\nGrace is the evidence of God's presence in your life. Moses refused to go without the Lord's presence. His presence is synonymous with His grace. Looking at how sinful we are, it takes His grace for us to be in His presence. When you are in His presence, grace protects you from the plans of those who declare themselves to be your enemies. Just like Moses, David also had an understanding of this. It is for this reason that he said; 'Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me. Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.' (Psalm 23:4-5 KJV). The Message Translation renders verse 5 as follows: 'You serve me a six-course dinner right in front of my enemies. You revive my drooping head; my cup brims with blessing.' Glory!\nMay grace preserve you and your family this year. I pray that because of the grace of God upon your life, no weapon formed against you shall prosper. I pray that by reason of grace, the Lord's presence will not abandon you despite your shortcomings. Though the Israelites have been a sinful people, they continue to enjoy God's goodness. Despite his sinfulness, David continued to enjoy God's grace. May this be your testimony! I pray that you will continue to enjoy God's goodness. Above all else, may grace cause you to make it to Heaven. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Many have argued that it is an ungodly holiday because of its origins and the way it is celebrated. However, we celebrate grace during Easter. Easter is the story of God's grace. Because of His love, God extended His grace to mankind. It is because of this amazing grace that you and I are saved. Ephesians 2:8 (GNT) reads; '...it is by God's grace that you have been saved through faith'. We were destined to spend eternity in the lake of fire. We can not make it to Heaven through our deeds, however, amazing grace qualifies us to enter into everlasting life.\nThis Easter reflect on God's love which is manifested in His saving grace. Grace, and only grace, is the foundation of the Christian life. The torture and death of our Lord Jesus Christ, and His resurrection, offered humanity abundance of grace. In Jesus Christ, we see mercy, compassion, true justice which resulted in our justification as well as abundance of grace. This is what Easter is all about.\nUnfortunately both the Easter and Christmas holidays have been commercialised. Real Easter has nothing to do with the Easter bunny, Easter egg, or Easter baskets and the worldliness associated with it. Easter is the story of God's compassion towards humanity. Anyone can have pity. However, very few can be compassionate. God did not just have pity on humanity. Instead He had compassion on humanity. Jesus did not just feel sorry for the pain and suffering of humanity. He took action to alleviate that pain. Humanity could not save itself. Feeling pity could not save humanity. In John 3:16 CEV we read; 'God loved the people of this world so much that He gave His only Son so that everyone who has faith in Him will have eternal life and never really die.' Compassion is love expressed. It is love in action. This is what Easter should remind us of. In the death and resurrection of Jesus Christ, the Trinity expressed love to mankind.\nEaster should be understood in the context of Psalm 49. No one could save themselves. The Psalmist wrote; 'Why should I be afraid when trouble comes? There is no need to fear when evil enemies surround me. They think their wealth will protect them. They brag about how rich they are. But no one has enough to buy back a life, and you cannot bribe God. You will never get enough money to pay for your own life. You will never have enough to buy the right to live forever and keep your body out of the grave. Look, the wise die the same as fools and stupid people. They die and leave their wealth to others. The grave will be their new home forever. And how much land they owned will not make any difference. People might be wealthy, but they cannot stay here forever. They will die like animals. That is what happens to all who trust in themselves and to anyone who accepts their way of life.' (Psalm 49:6-13 ERV). Take note; all the money or wealth in the world can not save a single person. No human being could die to save another. The price for salvation was blood untainted by sin. It was only God who could pay the price. The Psalmist said; 'But God will pay the price to save me from the grave. He will take me to be with Him.' (Psalm 49:15 ERV).\nEaster is a reminder that the price to save humanity was paid for in full. Jesus Christ's torture, death, burial, and resurrection is a memorial worthy of celebration. He suffered that you might not suffer. He went to hell on your behalf. Now you can be on your way to heaven. Jesus paid the ultimate price for your salvation. This is what Easter is all about. During this Easter, meditate on the grace of God that saved you. Jesus demonstrated His compassion towards humanity in that He did the only thing that was needed to help it, that is, dying on the cross and rising back to life. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Unless you are determined, you may not fully benefit from grace. Without determination, Ruth would not have benefited from the grace of God. Just like her mother-in-law, Naomi, she also, had lost everything. However, unlike many people who do not see a reason for hope when all hope seems lost, she decided to continue clinging to Naomi. As a result she benefit from the grace upon Naomi's life.\nRuth, just like Abraham, continued in hope. In Ruth 1:16-18 (GNT) Ruth answered, 'Don't ask me to leave you! Let me go with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Wherever you die, I will die, and that is where I will be buried. May the LORD's worst punishment come upon me if I let anything but death separate me from you!' When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.' Thus, there are certain people you should cling to if you are to fully benefit from grace. May you receive the grace that will cause you not to miss the people you are destined to meet in life. Ruth for example, was destined to meet Boaz.\nLot also became a partaker of the grace of God that was upon Abraham's life. Ruth benefited from Naomi's grace. The Philippians were partakers of the grace that was upon Paul's life. In Philippians 1:7 (KJV) Paul said to the Philippians, 'ye all are partakers of my grace'. May you become a partaker of God's grace that is upon someone's life. Hallelujah!\nIt takes grace for Romans 8:28 to come alive in our lives. All the sorrows Ruth experienced were turned around for her good. However, grace does not take responsibility away from you. You have a part to play. Naomi, Abraham, Lot and many Bible characters acted their faith and became beneficiaries of the grace of God. In Romans 4:18 (MSG) we read; 'When everything was hopeless, Abraham believed anyway, deciding to live not on the basis of what he saw he couldn't do but on what God said he would do. And so he was made father of a multitude of peoples.' Just like Abraham, don't live on the basis of what you cannot do, but on the basis of what the grace of God will do for you.\nI may not know the disappointments you have experienced. I may also not know the troubles you could have found yourself in. However, there is hope for you. The grace of God is all you need. Embrace grace through determination. Also cling to those people God has placed in your life to divinely connect you to His grace. In Job 14:7-9 (CSB) we read; 'There is hope for a tree: If it is cut down, it will sprout again, and its shoots will not die. If its roots grow old in the ground and its stump starts to die in the soil, the scent of water makes it thrive and produce twigs like a sapling.' In as much as Ruth thrived despite the pain she endured, you also shall thrive. You are much better than a tree that has been cut down. By the grace of God you shall thrive again. There is hope for you. My God shall surely increase your status and comfort you once again (Psalm 71:21 Voice Bible). Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Human connections are essential for you to fulfil your destiny. Without meeting Potiphar, Joseph would not have become the Prime Minister of Egypt. It was absolutely necessary for Joseph to be sold into slavery, be falsely accused by Potiphar's wife and eventually be thrown into prison. Joseph had to go through the process for him to become the Prime Minister of Egypt. Similarly, Hannah, Samuel, Ruth, David, Paul and all the other Bible characters needed human connections for them to fulfil their callings. Even the Lord Jesus Christ needed John the Baptist to usher Him into His earthly Ministry. He was also supposed to be arrested, tortured and crucified for salvation to be possible.\nThere are certain situations you should go through for you to become all you were created to be. Receive the grace to go through the process of becoming. Many people want to be the final product without going through the process. In Isaiah 43:2 (NIrV) we read, 'You will pass through deep waters. But I will be with you. You will pass through the rivers. But their waters will not sweep over you. You will walk through fire. But you will not be burned. The flames will not harm you.' Hallelujah! You must of necessity go though the storms of life for you to become all you were created to be.\nI would not have become what I am today without meeting certain people and having to go through certain situations. The people included a school principal who joined the school when I was in Form 6, my wife, former teachers and also brothers and sisters in Christ. Build relationships with people, both Christians and non Christians. Receive the grace to meet all those people you are destined to meet, both good and bad, as they will all add value to your life. Also receive the grace to go through whatever situation you may find yourself in.\nIn as much as grace enabled Joseph and other Bible characters to go through the process of becoming, it will also see you through. All you need to do is embrace it. His grace is sufficient for you. Grace will see you through. The Lord is assuring you by these words; 'When you face stormy seas I will be there with you with endurance and calm; you will not be engulfed in raging rivers. If it seems like you're walking through fire with flames licking at your limbs, keep going; you won't be burned.' (Isaiah 43:2 Voice). Glory to God! Grace will see you through, therefore, keep going. You will make it in life. You will fulfill your calling. You will become all you were created to be. Above all, you will make it to heaven, for grace will preserve you.

The apostles spoke to them and encouraged them to keep on living in the grace of God'. Paul and Barnabas encouraged the saints 'to keep living in the grace of God'. May I also take this opportunity to encourage you keep on living in the grace of God. Hallelujah! If grace was very important for the early Church, then it is still also very important for our generation and the Church today.\nSo what does it mean to live in the grace of God? It means living with the consciousness of what Jesus did for us. It means that even when you make a mistake, you don't have to beat yourself up. All you need to do is surrender to God believing that His grace is all you need. John writes: 'My little children, I am telling you this so that you will stay away from sin. But if you sin, there is someone to plead for you before the Father. His name is Jesus Christ, the one who is all that is good and who pleases God completely (1John 2:1 TLB). Take note, 'If', and not 'when' you sin,...\nTo live in grace also means to cast all your cares on God because He cares so much for you. It is to know and live Romans 8:28. It's not enough to just quote Romans 8:28. You have to experience this scripture and be driven by it when you face challenges, troubles and sufferings. Romans 8:28 (KJV) reads; 'And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose'. Hallelujah! All things! not some things! The question is, are you convinced that because you are living in grace, all things are being turned around into something that will benefit you? Do you believe that you can never be disadvantaged no matter what?\nThe Passion Translation renders Romans 8:28 as follows; 'So we are convinced that every detail of our lives is continually woven together to fit into God's perfect plan of bringing good into our lives, for we are his lovers who have been called to fulfill his designed purpose'. Are you convinced that God is able to turn every mess in your life into a message of His grace? Still, the Voice Bible reads; 'We are confident that God is able to orchestrate everything to work toward something good and beautiful when we love Him and accept His invitation to live according to His plan'. How confident are you that God is not only able to, but He is orchestrating every mess in your life into something good?\nLiving in grace means that you are untouchable. This is what is meant by Acts 17:28 (KJV) which reads; 'in Him we live, and move, and have our being'. Picture a baby in it's mother's womb. It lives, moves and get it's sustenance from the mother. All harm that is aimed at it, should hit the mother first before it gets to it. Because you live in grace, nothing gets to you unless God has permitted it. Whatever, has been permitted is beneficial to you. This is what we read in 1 Corinthians 10:13 (TPT); 'We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust Him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that will bring you out of it victoriously.' Meditatively ponder on the fact that God screens and filters every test that you may face. He provides a way of escape. He causes all things to benefit you. Hallelujah! Keep living in grace!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

However, many of God's people do not enjoy the grace of God because they do not take advantage of it. Many Bible characters who were able to take advantage of God’s grace enjoyed its protection and provision. Some of those who took advantage of God's grace include Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Hannah, David and Paul.\nTo take advantage God's grace, put your faith in action. If you do not put your faith to work, you will never experience all the dimensions of grace. Your life may be preserved but you may never really enjoy life on earth. In as much as life on earth is a journey, you should endure and enjoy it. Grace provides for both, your endurance and enjoyment.\nIsaac for example, took advantage of grace by sowing his seed during a time of famine in Gerar. Whilst Isaac was contemplating migrating to Egypt in search of greener pastures, God appeared to him and said; \"Do not go down to Egypt, but do as I tell you. Live here as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you.\" (Genesis 26:2-3 NLT). Isaac correctly interpreted this to mean that God's grace was upon him. To take advantage of this grace, Isaac sowed his seed in this land of famine. The outcome of this act of faith was him becoming wealthy. In Genesis 26:12-13 (ERV) we read; \"Isaac planted fields in that place, and that year he gathered a great harvest. The LORD blessed him very much. Isaac became rich. He gathered more and more wealth until he became a very rich man.\" Just like Isaac, you can also take advantage of grace by putting your faith to work.\nIn Psalm 37:25 (ERV) David also testifies; \"I was young, and now I am old, but I have never seen good people left with no one to help them; I have never seen their children begging for food\". From his childhood, David experienced God's provision. He also witnessed God providing for good people and their families. How does God provide for His people? He simply gives them the grace to get wealth. It is for this reason Moses said to the Israelites, \"Always remember that it is the Lord your God who gives you power to become rich, and He does it to fulfill His promise to your ancestors\" (Deuteronomy 8:18 TLB). The New International Reader's Version renders this verse as follows; \"But remember the LORD your God. He gives you the ability to produce wealth.\" This ability or power is part of the package known as God's grace. David believed so much in grace no wonder why he boldly proclaimed; \" Because the Lord is my Shepherd, I have everything I need!\" (Psalm 23:1 TLB). He trusted God for provision throughout his life. In other words, he believed in God's grace. You can also start living like David. This will result in you experiencing the immeasurable greatness of God's blessing (grace, power) up until your life becomes an advertisement of God's grace (Ephesians 1:19 TPT).\nLike David, may you also be able to boldly say; \" Because the Lord is my Shepherd, I have everything I need!\". Take advantage of grace by putting your faith into action! Endure and enjoy life! May you \"flourish like palm trees and grow tall as the cedars of Lebanon\" (Psalm 92:12 TLB). Even in your old age, may you still \"produce fruit and be vital and green!\" (Psalm 92:4 TLB). Be fruitful in season and out of season! \"May grace and peace be yours in full measure!\" 1 Peter 1:2b GNT). Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

When you receive a deeper revelation of grace, you will cast all your cares on God because He cares for you. God Himself has said, \"I will never leave you alone, never! And I will not loosen my grip on your life!\" (Hebrews 13:5b TPT). Hallelujah! When you deeply ponder on this, you will stop living in fear. You will boldly face the future!\nTake note: God didn't say He will be with you only when you do what is right. The only condition given for you to enjoy every blessing of the Kingdom of God is being a man or woman of faith. Without living by faith you will never please God (Hebrews 11:6). Faith makes you to run to God even after sinning. It is faith that will result in you casting all your cares on God. You stand in grace through your faith in God and His Word. Faith is the key you need in order to enjoy the grace of God. In Romans 5:2 (NIrV) we read; \"Through faith in Jesus we have received God's grace. In that grace we stand. We are full of joy because we expect to share in God's glory.\" Hallelujah! Take note: In the grace of God we stand. We do not fall! It doesn't matter what we may face, we stand! We may face the storms of life but we continue standing after each and every one of them. Glory to Jesus!\nWhen you deeply ponder on the grace of God you will find yourself singing the hymn \"Amazing Grace\" with tears rolling down your cheeks. Imagine a typical mother's love towards her baby. When the baby is dirty, a typical mother still hugs and carries it. I know there are some mothers who will not allow their dirty babies to run towards them when they are in their nice clothes. However, your heavenly Father's love towards you can never be compared to that of even the best mothers towards their children. Even after swimming in the 'sewer', when you come running towards your heavenly Father, He stretches His hands to embrace you. This act of faith; running towards God, results in the blood of Jesus cleansing you. You have access into the abundance of God's grace through your faith.\nMy God will never leave nor forsake you. Through His grace, He will turn each and every one of your troubles into testimonies. Through faith we are assured of the abundance of God's grace. Therefore, cast all your cares on Him. This is a sure way of experiencing the immeasurable greatness of God's power (grace). You are a victor because of grace! Fight the good fight of faith. Move from faith to faith, from strength to strength and from one dimension of grace to another. This is your season! In fact every season is favourable to you because God is always for you. Rejoice in the Lord! I say it again, rejoice! \"Be cheerful with joyous celebration in every season of life. Let joy overflow, for you are united with the Anointed One!\" (Philippians 4:4 TPT).

Waiting is one of the key concepts of the Christian lifestyle. The Bible teaches us to wait in anticipation for the future glory. When we pray, we are expected to wait in anticipation for God to answer us. Many have prayed but have been disappointed because they never waited for God to answer them. Without embracing grace, it is almost impossible to wait on God. Our heavenly Father knows that it is impossible for His people to wait on Him. It is for this reason that He supplies His grace. In John 15:5 (KJV) the Lord Jesus Christ said; \"for without Me ye can do nothing\". May \"the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you\" so that you may be able to do all things; waiting included (1 Corinthians 16:23 KJV).\nIn Psalm 37:34 KJV we are instructed: \"Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see it.\" We have seen the wicked prospering. We even envy those who don't serve the Living God because all seems to be well with them. However, there are promises for those who choose to wait on the Lord. One of the promises is that those that wait on God shall inherit this earth. This is a great promise. Don't loose your salvation. 1 Corinthians 2:9 (TPT) reads; \"Things never discovered or heard of before, things beyond our ability to imagine - these are the many things God has in store for all His lovers\". There is a glorious future for you. Embrace the grace to wait on God.\nIsaiah 40:31 (TPT) reads; But those who wait for Yahweh's grace will experience divine strength. They will rise up on soaring wings and fly like eagles, run their race without growing weary, and walk through life without giving up.\" Hallelujah! When people around you are cast down, you shall declare that there's a lifting up! When everyone else around you is fainting, you shall be moving forward, because you have embraced the grace to wait on Jehovah, you shall surely continue to experience the immeasurable greatness of God's power!\nAlthough you may find yourself pressed on every side by troubles, you will never be crushed and broken. You may even become perplexed because of not knowing why things happen as they do, but because of grace, you don't give up and quit. You may find yourself being hunted down, but God never abandons you. Although you may get knocked down, may you receive the grace to get up again and keep going. Hallelujah!*Scripture of the Week*: 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 (TLB); We are pressed on every side by troubles, but not crushed and broken.

There are even preachers who preach; \"Once saved, forever saved\", which is quite misleading. It is important to note that we can never appropriate grace apart from our faith. It is also important to note that we can also loose our salvation. When you get born again, your name is written in the book of life, however, if you backslide, your name is removed from this book. In as much as you access grace through faith, you may fall from grace and thus receive the grace of God in vain. Similarly the grace of God can also be frustrated.\nAre you still living in grace or you are now living outside of it? Living in grace is what Paul communicated when he said, \"We live in God; we move in God; we exist in God.\" (Acts 17:28 Voice). Grace is what makes it possible for us to live, move and have our existence in God. However, we may find ourselves living outside of grace. In Galatians 5:4 (GNT) we read; \"Those of you who try to be put right with God by obeying the Law have cut yourselves off from Christ. You are outside God's grace.\" The New King James Version renders this verse as follows; \"You have become estranged from Christ, you who attempt to be justified by law; you have fallen from grace.\" You can never be justified by your own deeds. Acknowledge and access God's grace by faith.\nPaul acknowledged God's grace. For instance, in 1 Corinthians 15:10 (NKJV) he wrote; \"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me\". Hallelujah! What have you accomplished for the Kingdom of God through His grace working through you? The grace of God is an enabling force that you should make use of to accomplish great things for the Kingdom of God. Do not be counted among those who receive the grace of God in vain and those who frustrate it. In 2 Corinthians 6:1 (NKJV) we are instructed; \"We then, as workers together with Him also plead with you not to receive the grace of God in vain.\" Achieve and accomplish through the grace of God. If you don't put your faith to work, you will be counted among those who receive the grace of God in vain. If you strive to accomplish through your own efforts ignoring the grace of God, you will be counted among those who frustrate it. Like Paul declare, \"I do not frustrate the grace of God\" (Galatians 2:21 KJV).\nThe Passion Translation renders 2 Corinthians 6:1 as follows: \"Now, since we are God's coworkers, we beg you not to take God's marvelous grace for granted, allowing it to have no effect on your lives\". Hallelujah! Don't take God's grace for granted. Put your faith to work and allow grace to enable you to accomplish great things. I pray that you may one day proudly declare like Paul saying; \"But by the grace of God I am what I am, and His grace toward me was not in vain; but I labored more abundantly than they all, yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me\". May you produce fruit and accomplish great things through the grace of God. Glory to Jesus!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

In Philippians 2:12 (KJV) we are instructed; \"Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.\" The New Living Translation renders Philippians 2:12-13 (NLT); \"Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear. For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases Him.\" Hallelujah! God supplies the grace (power) you need for you to work out your salvation with fear and trembling. Thus, put your faith into action and take advantage of the grace of God upon your life.\nJudas Iscariot was one of the twelve apostles. He was privileged to be one of the chosen few who ate and walked with Jesus. He arguably heard all of Jesus' sermons. Additionally, Judas witnessed Jesus' miracles. He had the knowledge that Jesus is the Son of God. Despite him having been chosen to be an heir of salvation, he fell from grace. Although Judas \"knew\" Jesus and interacted with Him, he did not understand grace. Although Peter fell from grace when he denied Jesus, by faith , he reclaimed his position as an heir of salvation. In other words, Peter worked out his salvation with fear and trembling. Judas Iscariot on the other hand, did nothing to reclaim his lost position. Jesus Christ died for the sins of everyone one, those of Judas included. Had Judas Iscariot meditatively pondered on Jesus' teachings like the lost lamb, the lost coin and the lost son (in Luke 15), he would probably have repented like Peter and regained his salvation. Do not take the grace of God for granted. You might fall from grace.\"So now, my beloved, obey as you have always done, not only when I am with you, but even more so when I can't be. Continue to work out your salvation, with great fear and trembling, because God is energizing you so that you will desire and do what always pleases Him.\" (Philippians 2:12-13 Voice). Jehovah is supplying you with His grace so that you may do what pleases Him. His grace is not for you to simply make it to heaven but also for you to accomplish great things for the Kingdom of God here on earth. If you have fallen from grace, find your way back into the sheepfold like Peter. Don't follow the steps of Judas Iscariot who fell and did not regain his salvation. \"Work hard to show the results of your salvation!\" Hallelujah! Brothers and sisters in Christ, \"be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus!\" (2 Timothy 2:1 KJV). Don't passively interact with grace like those who receive the grace of God in vain. Instead, put your faith into action and take advantage of grace to accomplish great things for the Kingdom of God. \"May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you\" (1 Corinthians 16:23 NLT). Amen!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

For that giving to be acceptable to God, it should flow from the heart. 2 Corinthians 9:7-8 (TPT) reads; \"Let giving flow from your heart, not from a sense of religious duty. Let it spring up freely from the joy of giving-all because God loves hilarious generosity! Yes, God is more than ready to overwhelm you with every form of grace, so that you will have more than enough of everything-every moment and in every way. He will make you overflow with abundance in every good thing you do.\" Glory to Jesus! When you become a generous giver through the grace of God, you qualify to enjoy abundance of grace. Take note that God is \"more ready to overwhelm\" cheerful givers whose hearts are in their giving with grace in all its dimensions. Glory!\nWe do not give because we have much but because we allow ourselves to be empowered by grace to do so. We should take advantage of the grace of God to accomplish great things for the Kingdom of God. The Macedonians are a great example of Christians who took advantage of the grace of giving. They were very poor but they did not allow their circumstances to determine their lifestyles. Instead of becoming beggars, they took bold steps of faith and became generous givers. Instead of speaking the language of the poor, they spoke faith-filled words. They had an understanding of what it means to be joint-heirs with the Lord Jesus. In 2 Corinthians 8:1-3 (TPT) we read; \"Beloved ones, we must tell you about the grace God poured out upon the churches of Macedonia. For even during a season of severe difficulty and tremendous suffering, they became even more filled with joy. From the depths of their extreme poverty, super-abundant joy overflowed into an act of extravagant generosity. For I can verify that they spontaneously gave, not only according to their means but far beyond what they could afford.\" Glory! Grace empowered the Macedonians to accomplish far beyond their abilities. May this also be your testimony! Through grace, you can do that which appears to be impossible.\nMake an impact in other people's lives. Let your impact be felt in your Church, community and nation. Through taking advantage of the grace of God you can accomplish great things. Stop living for yourself and your immediate family. Refuse to live from hand-to-mouth. Get out of your comfort zone. Through grace, become all you were created to be. Dream big! Take action! You are a battle-axe in Jehovah's hand. Put your faith to work and be counted among the heroes and heroines of faith of Hebrews Chapter 11. Hallelujah! I say it again, take advantage of grace! \"Now, may the grace and joyous favor of the Lord Jesus Christ, the unambiguous love of God, and the precious communion that we share in the Holy Spirit be yours continually. Amen!\" (2 Corinthians 13:14 TPT).*You can worship with us every Sunday at Higher Life Centre Ezulwini from 11 am to 1.30 pm*\nFor more information contact +268 7626 8322, +268 7979 6755, +268 7643 8018 or +268 7604 5323\nYou can email us at higherlifec@gmail.com"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Many people follow certain individuals but they end up giving up. Throughout the history of Christianity, there are many who dedicated their lives to following Jesus. However, not everyone of them followed Him to the very end as many ended up falling away. Judas Iscariot was one of those who dedicated himself to following the Lord Jesus but did not embrace the grace to follow until the very end. I pray that you are not counted among those who fall along the way. Embrace the grace to endure to the very end.\nThough Judas Iscariot was one of the chosen apostles of the Lord Jesus Christ, he followed Him without fully comprehending the Master's vision. He later realised that what he thought was not in line with the Lord's vision. As a result, he betrayed the Lord Jesus and ended up commiting suicide.\nPaul admonishes us to imitate him as he imitates Jesus Christ our Lord. In as much as the Lord Jesus pleased the Father in that He obeyed and completed His mission, Paul also obeyed and finished well. He said, he was not disobedient to the heavenly vision. 'So you see, King Agrippa, I have not been disobedient to what was revealed to me from heaven' (Acts 26:19 (TPT). Paul also testified that he fought the good fight and kept the faith. He said in 2 Timothy 4:7 (KJV); 'I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith'. Hallelujah! Embrace the grace to follow so that one day when you are about to depart from this world, you can speak like Paul. Paul says; 'Follow my example, just as I follow the example of Christ' (1 Corinthians 11:1 ERV).'May grace and peace be yours in full measure through your knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord' (2 Peter 1:2 GNT). Embrace the grace to follow Jesus Christ to the very end. Irrespective of the circumstances you may find yourself in, stay rooted in the grace of God! Grace will ultimately usher you into the inheritance of those predestined to be heirs of salvation. I say it again, embrace the grace to follow Jesus to the very end.

One interesting thing about Paul is that he had a passion to know God. He expressed his greatest aspiration and desire using the following words; 'That I may know Him, and the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings, being made conformable unto His death' (Philippians 3:10 (KJV). Hallelujah!\nMany people are comfortable with being born again and happy with going to Church every week. To Paul, this was not enough. He expressed this by the following words. 'My passion is to be consumed with him and not clinging to my own 'righteousness' based in keeping the written Law. My 'righteousness' will be his, based on the faithfulness of Jesus Christ-the very righteousness that comes from God. And I continually long to know the wonders of Jesus more fully and to experience the overflowing power of his resurrection working in me. I will be one with him in his sufferings and I will be one with him in his death. Only then will I be able to experience complete oneness with him in his resurrection from the realm of death. I admit that I haven't yet acquired the absolute fullness that I'm pursuing, but I run with passion into his abundance so that I may reach the purpose that Jesus Christ has called me to fulfill and wants me to discover. I don't depend on my own strength to accomplish this; however I do have one compelling focus: I forget all of the past as I fasten my heart to the future instead.' (Philippians 3:9-13 TPT). What is your greatest passion in life? You do not depend on your own strength to know God. It takes grace to have such a passion to know God. Paul acknowledged this when he said; 'I don't depend on my own strength to accomplish this'. Hallelujah! May you receive the grace and enablement to strive to know God.\nIn 2 Timothy 1:12 (KJV) Paul then said; 'For the which cause I also suffer these things: nevertheless I am not ashamed: for I know whom I have believed, and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day.' Hallelujah! Towards the end of his life on earth Paul testified that he knew the One he had believed. This is how we should all finish. Towards the end your your days on earth you should be able to say; 'I know Him whom I have believed. Embrace the grace to spend your life on earth striving to know Jesus Christ our Lord and the power of His resurrection.\nFollow Paul's example. In 1 Corinthians 11:1 (TLB) he said; 'And you should follow my example, just as I follow Christ's.' Embrace the grace to forget the past. Focus on getting to know Jesus Christ our Lord. In Jesus you have a glorious future. Because He is alive, you can boldly face the future! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

To him be the glory, now and forever! Amen.' Hallelujah! You should continue growing in grace!\nMany of God's children suffer because they have remained babies in Christ. Whereas there is nothing wrong with being a baby in Christ, remaining a baby in Christ attracts many problems. In 1 Peter 2:2-3 (TPT) Apostle Peter encourages us to grow. He says; 'In the same way that nursing infants cry for milk, you must intensely crave the pure spiritual milk of God's Word. For this 'milk' will cause you to grow into maturity, fully nourished and strong for life - especially now that you have had a taste of the goodness of the Lord Jehovah and have experienced his kindness.' Hallelujah! All babies in Christ should crave the Word of God. It is the source of all the necessary 'nutrients' to grow in grace. Thus, desire the pure milk of the Word that you may grow thereby. Jesus Christ is the Word of God (John 1:1-3). The more of God's Word you know, the more you know Jesus Christ and the more you grow.\nThe Passion Translation renders 2 Peter 3:18 (TPT) as follows; 'But continue to grow and increase in God's grace and intimacy with our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. May he receive all the glory both now and until the day eternity begins. Amen!' Hallelujah! Continue to crave the Word of God so that you may continue to grow in grace!

Stop seeing yourself as a victim of sin and start reigning as a victor and a king. In Romans 5:17 (TPT) we read; 'Death once held us in its grip, and by the blunder of one man, death reigned as king over humanity. But now, how much more are we held in the grip of grace and continue reigning as kings in life, enjoying our regal freedom through the gift of perfect righteousness in the one and only Jesus, the Messiah!' Hallelujah! Adam's sin resulted in the suffering of humanity. However, Jesus Christ reversed the grip sin had on humanity. He showered those who would dare to have faith in Him with abundance of grace. You are supposed to make use of this grace and reign in life.\nThe New International Reader's Version renders Romans 5:17 as follows: 'One man sinned, and death ruled over all people because of his sin. What will happen is even more sure than this. Those who receive the rich supply of God's grace will rule with Christ. They will rule in his kingdom. They have received God's gift and have been made right with him. This will happen because of what the one man, Jesus Christ, has done.' Have you received the rich supply of God's grace? Have you been taking advantage of this grace to reign with Jesus Christ. If you are one of those who have received the abundance of grace, you have the right to use the name of Jesus. By faith, you mention the name of Jesus and the stubborn circumstances of life bow (Philippians 2:10-11).\nSpeak in the name of Jesus and rule over the challenges in your life. Speak to, and do not describe the stubborn circumstances of your life in the authority of Jesus Christ. By the grace of God you got saved. In Ephesians 2:5-6 (TPT) we read; 'Even when we were dead and doomed in our many sins, he united us into the very life of Christ and saved us by his wonderful grace! He raised us up with Christ the exalted One, and we ascended with him into the glorious perfection and authority of the heavenly realm, for we are now co-seated as one with Christ!' Hallelujah!

However, have faith in the Word of God and the grace of God. Do not meditate on your weaknesses. Grace will see you through the fires, water-bodies, hills and mountains.\nIn 2 Corinthians 12:8-9 (TPT) we read; 'Three times I pleaded with the Lord to relieve me of this. But he answered me, 'My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.' So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I'm weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.' Have you prayed and it seems like God is not answering you? Are you weak and feel like you cannot go on? Embrace grace! Meditatively ponder on His grace which is sufficient for you.\nWhat is your approach to stressful situations in your life? Paul said; 'So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I'm weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me.' Do you celebrate your weaknesses like Paul? How real is grace to you? Do you have a revelation of the word, grace? Some answer to the name: Grace, but have no clue what grace is. When you embrace grace and have a deeper revelation of it, you will instinctively know that all will be well with you even when passing through valleys of the shadow of death.\nPaul experienced many problems in his life. Towards the end of his life, he experienced a terrible storm at sea. In Acts 27:20 (TPT) we read; 'After many days of seeing neither the sun nor the stars, and with the violent storm continuing to rage against us, all hope of ever getting through it alive was abandoned'. The fact that you may have found yourself in the middle of a violent storm does not mean that God has abandoned you. It is after such an experience that you fully comprehend that His grace is indeed sufficient for you. During the storm Paul said to those he was sailing with; 'So listen, men: you must not give up hope! Keep up your courage! I have faith in God that things will turn out exactly as I was told last night.' (Acts 27:25 Voice). Hallelujah! If you are sailing with me, be strong and very courageous!

God may not shield His people from problems. Instead He equips them with sufficient grace to go through whatever problems they may encounter. At some point in his life, Paul had a terrible experience. It caused him so much serious discomfort that he labelled it, 'a thorn in the flesh' (2 Corinthians 12:7). Three times he prayed for God to take it away. However, God did not take it away. He instructed Paul to focus on grace. God said to Paul; 'My grace is all you need, for my power is greatest when you are weak.' (2 Corinthians 12:9 GNT). Hallelujah! Grace is all you need. It doesn't matter the kind of situation you may find yourself in, His grace will not only preserve your life but will also see you through.\nIn Psalm 34:19 (KJV) we read; 'Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all'. Many people become Christians as a way of running away from troubles. However, many of them become disappointed when it seems like God is not protecting them from their painful experiences. God does not exist to stop bad things from happening to you. He however, provides you with sufficient grace so that you will be able to stand your ground during evil times. In Ephesians 6:13 (NLT) we are instructed; 'Therefore, put on every piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.' It's your responsibility to dress for battle. God expects you to dress yourself up in the armor that He Himself provides. You are a soldier in God's army. You are not a civilian. Dress up and live like a soldier because you are one!\nThe New Living Translation renders Psalm 34:19 as follows: 'The righteous person faces many troubles, but the LORD comes to the rescue each time'. Who are the righteous? They are none other than God's people. You are not shielded from pain and suffering. The evil that comes your way is necessary. Face it! Be strong and courageous in the face of painful experiences. Brothers and sisters in Christ, when pain becomes unbearable, grace becomes our only hope. When we have prayed and it seems as if God has not answered we should take comfort in knowing that His grace is sufficient for us.

Many people fail to understand why God allows good people to experience pain and suffering. In Psalm 34:19 (TLB) we read; 'The good man does not escape all troubles - he has them too. But the Lord helps him in each and every one.' Pain and suffering are often inevitable. When we experience pain and suffering, grace becomes our hope.\nIn as much as pain and suffering are universally associated with sin, the suffering of God's people may have nothing to do with this. Jesus experienced pain and suffering because of our sins. Sin has very little to do with our pain and suffering because Jesus paid the ultimate price for our sins. Thus, the pain and suffering of God's people should largely be seen in the context of grace. In John 9:1-3 (GNT) we read; 'As Jesus was walking along, He saw a man who had been born blind. His disciples asked Him, 'Teacher, whose sin caused him to be born blind? Was it his own or his parents' sin?' Jesus answered, 'His blindness has nothing to do with his sins or his parents' sins. He is blind so that God's power might be seen at work in him.' Hallelujah! The man was born blind for the purpose of God's grace to be manifested.\nGrace is the essence of Christianity. We did not earn our righteousness, instead it is a free gift made available for us because of grace. Job did not suffer the way he did because he was the worst sinner of his generation. However, he suffered the way he did for the power of grace to be seen. Whereas Job played his part in that he maintained his integrity (Job 1:22, 2:9), it was indeed grace which did not only preserve his life, but also saw him through his pain and suffering. Though many people blame God for their pain and suffering, Job did not. Stop blaming God for your pain and suffering. He has done everything for you. He has protected you from certain pains and sufferings and supplied you with abundance of grace to go through those pains and sufferings He has allowed in your life.\nIf you are going through pain and suffering take comfort in knowing that God has not abandoned you. God Himself says to you; 'I will never fail you. I will never abandon you.' (Hebrews 13:5 NLT). Hallelujah! 'We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being. But God will be faithful to you. He will screen and filter the severity, nature, and timing of every test or trial you face so that you can bear it. And each test is an opportunity to trust Him more, for along with every trial God has provided for you a way of escape that will bring you out of it victoriously.' (1 Corinthians 10:13 TPT). Grace will see you through your times of testing! May each time you experience pain and suffering be an opportunity for you to trust God more.

There are two key themes in this verse. These are: the suffering of godly people and their rescue or deliverance. Take note, it says The Lord's people 'may suffer a lot'. Although, this may happen, Jehovah will always supply the grace for them to safely pass through. Take note, it says the Lord 'will always bring them safely through'. Always! not some times! Glory to Jesus! The grace of God will always see you through any form of pain and suffering you may find yourself in.'Paul and Barnabas preached the good news in Derbe and won some people to the Lord. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch in Pisidia. They encouraged the followers and begged them to remain faithful. They told them, 'We have to suffer a lot before we can get into God's kingdom.' (Acts 14:21-22 (CEV) What was Paul and Barnabas' message when they returned to the Churches they had established? They did not preach prosperity and other messages we always want to hear. They taught that suffering was necessary. Take note, they said that we 'have to suffer a lot' before we enjoy the blessings of the New Jerusalem; no tears, no pain, no mourning and no death (Revelation 21:1, 4).\nTake time to meditate on 1 Corinthians 10:13 (TPT) which reads; 'We all experience times of testing, which is normal for every human being.

Whatever pain and suffering you may be going through is not permanent. There's sufficient grace to see you through whatever situation you may find yourself in.

It is very unfortunate that many Christians have not heard the full Gospel. Many think that since the word Gospel means 'good news', there is now no place for such topics as the wrath of God in our sermons. Many have never heard about the wrath of God. It is very unfortunate that many Christians think that the God of the Old Testament is different from the God of the New Testament. Many have heard that Jesus Christ is the Saviour of the world, but have never meditatively pondered on what this is all about. Many Christians think that Jesus saved them from Satan and sin. They are ignorant of the reality that Jesus Christ saved them from the wrath of God (see John 3:36 TLB). The Gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ is centred on this theme:- Jesus saves those who believe in Him as their personal Saviour from the wrath of God (Romans 5:9, 1 Thessalonians 1:10, Isaiah 13:9, Zephaniah 1:14-15). In 2 Corinthians 6:1 (TPT) we read; 'Now, since we are God's coworkers, we beg you not to take God's marvelous grace for granted, allowing it to have no effect on your lives'. I pray that you may not find yourself among those who take God's marvelous grace for granted and have to face the wrath of God.\nIt is very important to note that what makes us escape from the wrath of God is believing in Jesus Christ as the only Way of escape from His (God's) wrath (John 14:6). The God of the Old Testament is the same God of the New Testament. The Ministry of Jesus Christ is what makes it appear as if He is different. God will never condone ungodliness and unrighteousness. The Bible clearly states that Jesus Christ is busy interceding for us (Romans 8:34, Hebrews 7:25, 1 John 2:1).\nGod is the same yesterday, today and forever (Hebrews 13:8, Psalm 102:27). He does not change (Malachi 3:6, Numbers 23:19). The Lord Jesus warned us to fear God because He has the power to kill and to cast the ungodly into hell (Luke 12:5). James echoes the same theme that God is the One with the power to save and to destroy (James 4:12). Many have only heard about how good God is. They have never heard about how terrible He too is. The Bible itself describes Him as being terrible (Nehemiah 1:5, 9:32, Psalm 66:5, 68:35, Zephaniah 2:11, Hebrews 10:31, Luke 12:5). Jehovah is terrible by virtue of His perfect holiness, His strict justice, His fearful judgements, His inscrutable dealings, His covenant faithfulness, and His infinite power (biblehub.com).\nIf you are a Christian wash your robes and make them clean in the blood of Jesus (Revelation 7:14, 22:14, Isaiah 1:18, Zechariah 3:3-5). Walk in the light of the Gospel and the blood of Jesus Christ will cleanse you from all sin (1 John 1:7, John 15:3). If you are not saved from the wrath of God, pray the following prayer and receive your salvation. It is time to make peace with God (Romans 5:1, Ephesians 2:18). Above all, as a child of God, do not fall from grace. Do not be counted among those who frustrate the grace of God or receive it in vain. Embrace grace! Hallelujah!\nPrayer of Salvation: Oh Lord God; Thank You for the love You demonstrated towards the world in giving Your precious Son; Jesus Christ, that anyone who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life (John 3:16). I believe that the Lord Jesus was born of a virgin; He died for my sins; and was raised back to life for my justification (Romans 4:25). Your Word says, 'whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved' (Acts 2:21). Your Word also says, 'That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation' (Romans 10:9-10). I RECEIVE the Lordship of Jesus Christ over my life. I RECEIVE remission of sin. I RECEIVE eternal life. I declare that I am born again. I am a new creation (2 Corinthians 5:17). From today onwards; I am conscious of my new life in Christ Jesus, and am led by the Holy Spirit. Amen!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

(34)","slug":{"current":"grace-34"},"date":"2024-08-24","content":[{"_type":"block","style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"A study of the Bible reveals that God, through His grace, uses ordinary human beings. The great men and women of the Bible were all full of weaknesses. Some of them, at some point in their lives, experienced anxiety, stress and depression. It may shock many people to learn that, even the Lord Jesus Christ sank into the worst form of stress and depression just before He was arrested. No other human being has ever sunken to that level of stress and depression the Lord Jesus experienced. Depression is more than just a mental health condition. It is often more of a 'just being human' problem. No human being is immune to depression. But, 'I say, 'You are gods; you are all children of the Most High. (Therefore, embrace grace, for you not to) 'die like mere mortals and fall like every other ruler.' Hallelujah! (Psalm 82:6-7 NLT- the words in brackets are mine).\nLet us look at some Biblical figures who struggled with depression at some point in their lives:\nKing David prayed; 'My inner being is in depression and my heart is heavy, dazed with despair. Lord, come quickly and answer me, for my depression deepens and I'm about to give up. Don't leave me now or I'll die!' (Psalm 143:4, 7 TPT). In Psalm 38:6 (ERV) David confessed; 'I am bent and bowed down. I am depressed all day long.' Still, in Psalm 42:9 (Voice Bible) David said; 'Even still, I will say to the True God, my rock and strength: 'Why have You forgotten me? Why must I live my life so depressed, crying endlessly while my enemies have the upper hand?' Even though David had many weaknesses and was often depressed, through the grace of God upon his life, he accomplished great things. Do not allow your struggle with stress and depression to pull you down. Through grace, you will achieve great things.\nJeremiah was also so depressed that he accused God of deception. He said; 'LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I am, and you have overpowered me. Everyone makes fun of me; they laugh at me all day long.' (Jeremiah 20:7 GNT). He even said, 'Cursed be the day that I was born! Cursed be the man who brought my father the news that a son was born. Let that messenger be destroyed like the cities of old which God overthrew without mercy. Terrify him all day long with battle shouts because he did not kill me at my birth! Oh, that I had died within my mother’s womb, that it had been my grave! Why was I ever born? For my life has been but trouble and sorrow and shame.' (Jeremiah 20:14-18 TLB). However, despite his struggle with depression, grace made him accomplish great things.\nElijah was so depressed that he too wanted to die. As a result, he prayed; 'I have had enough, LORD, Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died.' (1 Kings 19:4 NLT). Daniel also confessed; 'I was depressed and ill for several days...' (Daniel 8:27 GNT). The Bible has a record of many others who struggled with depression but were able to embrace grace. As a result, God accomplished great things through them.\nCast all your worries on Jesus because He cares for you. Do not entertain anxiety. It is your enemy. 'Anxiety in the heart of man causes depression, But a good word makes it glad' (Proverbs 12:25 NKJV). The Passion Translation renders this verse as follows: 'Anxious fear brings depression, but a life-giving word of encouragement can do wonders to restore joy to the heart'. Refuse to allow negative thoughts to isolate and imprison you. The Biblical cure for anxiety, stress and depression is a word of encouragement. Isaiah calls it 'a word in season'. In Isaiah 50:4 (KJV) we read; 'The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I should know how to speak a word in season to him that is weary...' Receive your word in season today and meditate on it! Grace will enable you to accomplish great things despite your shortcomings. Through grace, become all you were created to be. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

(35)","slug":{"current":"grace-35"},"date":"2024-08-31","content":[{"_type":"block","style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"As noted in last week's message, some of the great people recorded in the bible struggled with stress, anxiety and depression. In Proverbs 12:25 (TPT) we read; 'Anxious fear brings depression, but a life-giving word of encouragement can do wonders to restore joy to the heart'. Proverbs 17:22 (TPT) reads; 'A joyful, cheerful heart brings healing to both body and soul. But the one whose heart is crushed struggles with sickness and depression.'\nHezekiah just like David, Elijah and Jeremiah, was depressed too. He prayed; '...Yahweh, I am so depressed. Come and be my strength.' (Isaiah 38:14 TPT). Job also experienced severe depression. He said; 'I am always sad and depressed, without any relief. I stand up in the public meeting and cry for help, making sad sounds like the wild dogs, like the ostriches in the desert. My skin is burned and peeling away. My body is hot with fever. My harp is tuned to play songs of sorrow. My flute makes sad sounds like someone crying.' (Job 30:28-31 ERV). I may not know the season you are passing through. However, I know that grace will see you through any situation you may find yourself in. God has not abandoned you. What you may be going through is an opportunity for you to experience the immeasurable greatness of God's power.\nWe have a lot to learn from Paul and the Lord Jesus Christ, who also experienced stress and depression. Paul at some point did not know what to 'choose'. He said; 'to live or to die? I don’t know' (Philippians 1:22 ERV). I'm sure he was always praying and singing in the spirit and meditating on the Word (1 Corinthians 14:15,18, Genesis 50:20 cf Romans 8:28). No wonder he did not miss his encouragement. He testified, 'But God, who always knows how to encourage the depressed, encouraged us greatly by the arrival of Titus'. Hallelujah! (2 Corinthians 7:6 (TPT).\nBrothers and sisters, our salvation did not come cheap. The Lord Jesus purchased it through great suffering. Just before He was arrested His soul was so overwhelmed and crushed by depression 'He said to them, 'My heart is oppressed with anguish to the very point of death: wait here and keep awake.' (Mark 14:34 Weymouth New Testament). The greatest cause of the Lord Jesus' depression was that He was going to be separated from the Father for the very first time because of our sins. 'And being in an agony [of mind], He prayed [all the] more earnestly and intently, and His sweat became like great clots of blood dropping down upon the ground' (Luke 22:44 Amplified Bible). The Living Bible says that He 'was in such agony of spirit'. What is agony of the mind or spirit that the Lord Jesus experienced? It is the highest form of stress and depression. Remember Jesus Christ was hundred percent human and hundred percent God.\nReferring to Him, the prophet Isaiah said; 'He was looked down on and passed over, a man who suffered, who knew pain firsthand. One look at him and people turned away' ... a man of sorrows, acquainted with deepest grief' (Isaiah 53:2 MSG, 53:3b NLT). 'But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him; and with his stripes we are healed' (Isaiah 53:5 KJV). Hallelujah! He did it for you and me! Do not allow depression anymore in your life. Unlike King David, Elijah and Jeremiah who lived before Christ and were so overwhelmed with depression that they wished to die, embrace the grace to soldier on.\nGod has put people in place to speak His Word to encourage you. Thus, always position yourself to receive God's Word to you, 'not forsaking our meeting together [as believers for worship and instruction], as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another; and all the more [faithfully] as you see the day [of Christ's return] approaching (Hebrews 10:25 AMP). Embrace the grace to always value a word of encouragement. Do not be afraid. God’s plans, thoughts and purposes for your life cannot be restrained, derailed, thwarted or stopped. Grace will see you through any depressing seasons of your life. Hallelujah! May He also use you to encourage someone today both through your words and testimony."}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

(Hebrews 11:34 KJV). As evidenced in the last two messages, all the Bible characters were just ordinary human beings. They had the same daily struggles we have such as stress, anxiety, depression, doubts, being discouraged etc. The first step in appreciating the power of grace is recognising your weaknesses.\nThe Passion Translation renders Hebrews 11:34 as follows; '... In their weakness their faith imparted power to make them strong! Faith sparked courage within them and they became mighty warriors in battle, pulling armies from another realm into battle array.' Hallelujah! I like the New International Reader's Version which reads; '...Their weakness was turned to strength...' Waal! May your weaknesses be turned into strength by the grace of God. May all things, including your shortcomings be turned around for your good.\nApostle Paul recognised and acknowledged his weaknesses. Writing to the Corinthians, he said; 'And I was with you in weakness, and in fear, and in much trembling' (1 Corinthians 2:3 KJV). In 2 Corinthians 12:9-10 (TPT) he shares his testimony; 'But he answered me, 'My grace is always more than enough for you, and my power finds its full expression through your weakness.' So I will celebrate my weaknesses, for when I'm weak I sense more deeply the mighty power of Christ living in me. So I'm not defeated by my weakness, but delighted! For when I feel my weakness and endure mistreatment-when I'm surrounded with troubles on every side and face persecution because of my love for Christ-I am made yet stronger. For my weakness becomes a portal to God's power.' Hallelujah! Recognise and acknowledge your weaknesses. May your weaknesses become a portal of God's power! Hallelujah!\nDo you deny that you have weaknesses? I, for example, do have plenty of them and I know I need grace for me to endure and enjoy life. Without the power of grace, my weaknesses will send me to hell. If you were to know some of my weaknesses, you would be ashamed of me. Though God knows every one of my weaknesses, He is never ashamed of me. He also knew of David's weaknesses and He supplied His grace and turned them into blessings. Some examples of David's weaknesses were the adultery he commited with Bathsheba and then murdering her husband. Despite this, David's successor, King Solomon, was born to Bathsheba. God through His grace turned David's mess into a message of His love and grace (Romans 8:28). What makes you to think He will not turn all things around for your good?\nIsaiah says that 'those who wait for Yahweh's grace will experience divine strength' (Isaiah 40:31 TPT). May this be your testimony during this season of meditating on grace! The Lord says; '...let the weak say, I am strong' (Joel 3:10 KJV). My God will surely turn all things around for your good. May your weaknesses become portals of God's power! May your weaknesses become your strengths through God's grace! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

It is essential that you strive to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Word of God. Help someone else to grow. Growth is the reason behind the fivefold ministry. In Ephesians 4:14-15 (TPT) we read; 'And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into Him, the anointed Head of His body, the church.' Hallelujah! God expects you to grow. He also expects you to help someone else to do the same. It is essential for all of us to grow until we mature in the Lord.\nThere are many things that hinder growth. The Lord Jesus listed some of them in the Parable of the Sower. This Parable is centred on the sower (one with the grace to function in the fivefold ministry as a pastor, prophet, teacher, evangelist or an apostle), whose responsibility is to sow the Word of God in people's hearts. In Luke 8:14 (TPT) we read; 'The seed that falls into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful.' When the Word of God is sown in your heart, it is expected to germinate, make you grow to maturity and produce much fruit. In John 15:8 (TPT) we read, 'When your lives bear abundant fruit, you demonstrate that you are my mature disciples who glorify my Father!' The Work of Ministry, (Ephesians 4:11-15) is all about promoting christian growth to maturity.\nOur immaturity should come to an end. We should get to the point where we become like Jesus Christ. Mature Christians are not moved by troubles. They are bold and full of joy unspeakable even when passing through valleys of the shadow of death. They do not panic when there has been delays in the fulfilment of their dreams. Psalm 37:37 (TPT) reads, 'But you can tell who are the blameless and spiritually mature. What a different story with them! The godly ones will have a peaceful, prosperous future with a happy ending.' May this be your testimony. A peaceful and prosperous future with a happy ending is your portion. Keep feeding on the Word of God and continue to grow. Mature in your walk of faith! I say it again; surely there's a prosperous future with a happy ending for you! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

The favor of men increased upon his life, for he was loved greatly by God.' Hallelujah! Do not stop growing!'But continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, now and forever! Amen.' (2 Peter 3:18 GNT). Grow in wisdom and in grace! In 1 Corinthians 1:23-24 (GNT) we read; 'As for us, we proclaim the crucified Christ, a message that is offensive to the Jews and nonsense to the Gentiles; but for those whom God has called, both Jews and Gentiles, this message is Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God.' Jesus Christ is our wisdom. Thus, growing in wisdom means growing in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nGrowing in both grace and wisdom has many advantages. For instance, in Psalm 84:4-7 (TPT) we read; 'What pleasure fills those who live every day in your temple, enjoying you as they worship in your presence! Pause in his presence. How enriched are they who find their strength in the Lord; within their hearts are the highways of holiness! Even when their paths wind through the dark valley of tears, they dig deep to find a pleasant pool where others find only pain. He gives to them a brook of blessing filled from the rain of an outpouring. They grow stronger and stronger with every step forward, and the God of all gods will appear before them in Zion.' Hallelujah! Enjoying being in the house of God is a sure way of growing in grace and wisdom.\nGrow your roots deeper in God! This will enable you to continue to stand when you face the storms of life. May you be refreshed where others find only pain! May you grow stronger and stronger as you continue to grow in grace and wisdom. Move from faith to faith! This is your season to grow and prosper! Grow!

(5)*\nWhat made David differ from Old Testament folks? It was the fact that he did not just receive the grace of God, but he took advantage of it and grew in it. David did not live like the Old Testament people. He chose to be different. Through grace he became a man after God's heart (1 Samuel 13:14, Acts 13:22). It was not due to his righteousness or good deeds that he became this. He didn't strive to qualify to be a man after God's heart. Grace qualified him. When you embrace grace and grow in grace and wisdom (the word of God, Jesus Christ) you will become a man or woman after God's heart.\nIn Acts 13:22 NIrV we read, 'God removed him and made David their king. Here is God's witness about him. 'David, son of Jesse, is a man dear to my heart,' he said. 'David will do everything I want him to do.'' Hallelujah! The New Living Translation renders this verse as follows; 'But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.'' What does it mean to be a person after God's heart? It means one is dear to God's own heart; the one who gets God's attention, understands Him, is like God, or one that God identifies with. David is the only person God explicitly said, “He's a man after my own heart” (1 Samuel 13:14). Interestingly, when God said this, David was still a herdboy of his father's flock, before he was anointed by Samuel and long before he became the king of Israel. Waal! Grace!\nIn Luke 6:1-5 (TPT) we read; 'One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain and rubbed the husks off with their hands and ate it. This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, 'Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath day? Don't you know it's not permissible according to the law?' Jesus replied, 'Haven't you read the Scriptures? Haven't you read what King David did when he was hungry? He entered the sanctuary of God, took the bread of God's presence right off the sacred table, and shared it with his men. It was only lawful for the priests to eat the bread of God's presence. You need to know that the Son of Man is no slave to the Sabbath day, for I am master over the Sabbath.' Waal! This is the gospel. It makes you free! As already said earlier, David did not just receive the grace of God, he grew in it.\nContinue to grow in grace and wisdom! Don't allow people's judgements to derail you. Although you should reflect on people's comments and feedback, you should not allow any negative comments to derail you from pursuing God! Grace frees you from people's doctrines. David broke the Law of Moses by eating the bread that was reserved only for the priests. He also gave the same bread to his followers. Jesus commended David for his actions. David was a man after God's heart despite his shortcomings. God loves you! He values you! Take advantage of grace and become all you were created to be! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

(6)*\nEverything which is born is expected to grow. Reaching the stage of maturity is the purpose of growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Growth is never a goal. It is a means through which maturity is attained. In other words, you have to grow in order for you to attain maturity.\nIn Ephesians 4:11-16 (TPT) we read; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers. And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ. These grace ministries will function until we all attain oneness in the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed in the abundance of Christ. And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into him, the anointed Head of his body, the church. For his 'body' has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.' Hallelujah!\nJesus appoints certain individuals and empower them with the grace to function in the offices of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Please take note that no one is appointed into these offices (apostle, pastor, evangelist, teacher or prophet) due to being mature in the Lord. Most are actually appointed into the fivefold ministry whilst they are still babies in Christ. Jeremiah for instance, was called before he was even formed in his mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:4-5). He got to know about his calling whilst he was still a youth. Jeremiah received the grace to be a prophet when he was young and had to grow in it (grace) and wisdom (the word of God). Jesus expects those He called into the fivefold ministry to grow in grace and the knowledge of Him (the Word of God). These are just the starting point in the work of growth.\nThose called into the fivefold ministry are expected to labour for Church growth. By Church growth I am not referring to just numbers, but the maturity of Church members. Every Church member is expected to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. This means that every Church member is expected to not only grow in grace and wisdom, but to engineer growth in others through discipleship.\nYou need grace for you to grow in both grace itself and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. No one has the ability to transform other people's lives through the gospel unless they have received the grace to do so. It is for this reason that the Lord Jesus empowers people with the grace to function in Ministry. Unless one receives the grace to impact other people's lives, and be willing to grow in that grace and the knowledge of the Word of God, they may not contribute meaningfully to the Church of Jesus Christ. Pause and think! Are you still growing in grace and wisdom? What impact are you having in other people's lives? Be a disciple of Jesus Christ through making disciples. Promote growth in others. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

What does it mean for God's will to be done on earth the way it is done in heaven? Life in heaven is characterised by worship (Revelation 4:8-11, Revelation 5:7-14). God should be worshipped on earth the way He is worshipped in heaven.\nLet us look at Ephesians 4:11-14 (TPT) again. It reads; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers.

Take note that the purpose of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers is to nurture and prepare the saints for them to fulfil their own callings (the work of Ministry). The work of Ministry is centred on the growth of the Body of Christ (the Church). The work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers should come to an end when the Church attains oneness in the faith. The Church should get to a point where all divisions disappear. God's plan is for Christians to grow to the point where they become one in faith. You should stop being proud of belonging to Higher Life Centre or any other Church organisation. Become a member of the Body of Christ. In other words, become a Christian. Grow up! Mature in Christ!\nThe New International Reader's Version renders Ephesians 4:13 as follows: 'That will continue until we all become one in the faith. We will also become one in the knowledge of God's Son. Then we will be grown up in the faith. We will receive everything that Christ has for us.' The fivefold ministry will continue up until we become one in the faith! God's will must be done in on earth the way it is in heaven! There are no apostles in heaven neither are there prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Rather, there are worshippers in heaven. Our aim as we do the work of Ministry is to raise worshippers who will worship the God in truth (the Word of God) and in spirit (through the Ministry of the Holy Spirit).

It is essential that you strive to grow in grace and in the knowledge of the Word of God. Help someone else to grow. Growth is the reason behind the fivefold ministry. In Ephesians 4:14-15 (TPT) we read; 'And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into Him, the anointed Head of His body, the church.' Hallelujah! God expects you to grow. He also expects you to help someone else to do the same. It is essential for all of us to grow until we mature in the Lord.\nThere are many things that hinder growth. The Lord Jesus listed some of them in the Parable of the Sower. This Parable is centred on the sower (one with the grace to function in the fivefold ministry as a pastor, prophet, teacher, evangelist or an apostle), whose responsibility is to sow the Word of God in people's hearts. In Luke 8:14 (TPT) we read; 'The seed that falls into the weeds represents the hearts of those who hear the word of God but their growth is quickly choked off by their own anxious cares, the riches of this world, and the fleeting pleasures of this life. This is why they never become mature and fruitful.' When the Word of God is sown in your heart, it is expected to germinate, make you grow to maturity and produce much fruit. In John 15:8 (TPT) we read, 'When your lives bear abundant fruit, you demonstrate that you are my mature disciples who glorify my Father!' The Work of Ministry, (Ephesians 4:11-15) is all about promoting christian growth to maturity.\nOur immaturity should come to an end. We should get to the point where we become like Jesus Christ. Mature Christians are not moved by troubles. They are bold and full of joy unspeakable even when passing through valleys of the shadow of death. They do not panic when there has been delays in the fulfilment of their dreams. Psalm 37:37 (TPT) reads, 'But you can tell who are the blameless and spiritually mature. What a different story with them! The godly ones will have a peaceful, prosperous future with a happy ending.' May this be your testimony. A peaceful and prosperous future with a happy ending is your portion. Keep feeding on the Word of God and continue to grow. Mature in your walk of faith! I say it again; surely there's a prosperous future with a happy ending for you! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Language is one aspect that can be used to measure christian growth or maturity. There are different languages for babies, the youths, and those who have matured. It is also important to note that growth or maturity is something that is seen, so one does not have to go about announcing it. It is God who gives growth and increase. Growth and maturity come from God. However, you also have a responsibility in the process of growth. Therefore play your part, and allow God to play His.\nTo the Corinthians Paul had this to say; 'Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. And because you are immature infants in Christ, I had to nurse you and feed you with 'milk,' not with the solid food of more advanced teachings, because you weren't ready for it. In fact, you are still not ready to be fed solid food, for you are living your lives dominated by the mind-set of the flesh. Ask yourselves: Is there jealousy among you? Do you compare yourselves with others? Do you quarrel like children and end up taking sides? If so, this proves that you are living your lives centered on yourselves, dominated by the mind-set of the flesh, and behaving like unbelievers. For when you divide yourselves up in groups-a 'Paul group' and an 'Apollos group'-you're acting like people without the Spirit's influence. Who is Apollos, really? Or who is Paul? Aren't we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren't each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us? I was the one who planted the church and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow. This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.' (1 Corinthians 3:1-7 TPT).\nIt can be very difficult to explain certain things to children. In as much as it is important to have the faith of children, it is also equally important for us to have the faith of the mature. Paul said he found it impossible to explain certain things to the Corinthians because they could not comprehend the deeper things or the more advanced teachings of God. For instance, children find it difficult to wait on God. They generally do not understand the whole concept of waiting. In as much as there is nothing wrong with being a baby or teenager in Christ, to remain one for too long is dangerous. Babies and teenagers in Christ follow certain men of God rather than following Christ. They worship pastors instead of worshipping God.\nHave you identified your responsibilities in the growth process? For example, if you are to experience supernatural growth in your finances, then you need to put your faith to work. In Genesis 26:12-13 (CSB) we read; 'Isaac sowed seed in that land, and in that year he reaped a hundred times what was sown. The LORD blessed him, and the man became rich and kept getting richer until he was very wealthy.' God had instructed Isaac to stay in the land that was ravaged by famine with the promise of blessing him. Isaac understood that for God to bless him, he had a role to play. There are many Christians who confess right but do not have actions to buttress or support their confessions. Isaac worked, and God blessed his work. Paul says, God gives supernatural growth! Issac experienced it. I pray that my God will cause you to experience supernatural growth in all aspects of your life! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Although I had been a Christian from a very young (or from birth), I only experienced exponential growth in my Christian walk of faith about 20 years ago. I used to wonder why my pastor would suddenly drop to the basic teachings while teaching deeper revelations of the Kingdom of God. Then one day, he explained that some Christians in the congregation made it difficult for him to continue moving deeper and deeper in revelations as they were still immature and were not growing at the rate they were supposed to have been growing.\nIn 1 Corinthians 3:1-4 (TPT) Paul said; 'Brothers and sisters, when I was with you I found it impossible to speak to you as those who are spiritually mature people, for you are still dominated by the mind-set of the flesh.

Or who is Paul? Aren't we both just servants through whom you believed our message? Aren't each of us doing the ministry the Lord has assigned to us?' (1 Corinthians 3:5 TPT). Divisions in the Church of Jesus Christ is a major sign of immaturity. Unity among the believers is a sign of maturity. We read about this in Ephesians 4:15 (TLB); 'Instead, we will lovingly follow the truth at all times-speaking truly, dealing truly, living truly-and so become more and more in every way like Christ who is the Head of His body, the Church. Under His direction, the whole body is fitted together perfectly, and each part in its own special way helps the other parts, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.' Hallelujah!\nGrow in grace and in the knowledge of the Word of God! Do not hinder growth! Help the saints to grow by becoming an agent of growth. Do the work of ministry. Paul testifies; 'I was the one who planted the church and Apollos came and cared for it, but it was God who caused it to grow. This means the one who plants is not anybody special, nor the one who waters, for God is the one who brings the supernatural growth.' (1 Corinthians 3:6-7 TPT). Partner with the church's leadership in promoting the work of ministry the same way Apollos partnered with Paul. Once we play our different parts, God will surely provide supernatural growth. It is not enough to plant the Word of God in people’s hearts. Someone should water it! Do not expect the pastor to plant and water. Supernatural growth will not take place unless someone plants and another waters. The one who waters will also be watered (Proverbs 11:25). The Passion Translation renders this verse as follows: 'Those who live to bless others will have blessings heaped upon them, and the one who pours out his life to pour out blessings will be saturated with favor'.

When your faith is being tested, you need fellow believers to encourage you to soldier on. Christians should always gather for the purpose of watering each other. In Hebrews 10:24-25 (TPT), we are instructed; 'Discover creative ways to encourage others and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love. This is not the time to pull away and neglect meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.' Thus, there is a need for the saints to come up with creative ways of encouraging and motivating each other.\nGod's responsibility is to cause the Word sown in your heart to produce a lifestyle of the miraculous for you. Many professing Christians make the mistake of leaving everything up to God. In Jeremiah 4:3 (TLB) we read; 'The Lord is saying to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Plow up the hardness of your hearts; otherwise the good seed will be wasted among the thorns.'

And so they never grow into maturity.' Do not allow anything to do with life on earth (good or bad) to stunt your growth as a Christian.\nI pray for God to 'give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord' (2 Peter 1:2 NLT).

Reaching the stage of maturity is the purpose of growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Growth is never a goal. It is a means through which maturity is attained. In other words, you have to grow in order for you to attain maturity.\nIn Ephesians 4:11-16 (TPT) we read; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers. And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ. These grace ministries will function until we all attain oneness in the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed in the abundance of Christ. And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into him, the anointed Head of his body, the church. For his 'body' has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.' Hallelujah!\nJesus appoints certain individuals and empower them with the grace to function in the offices of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Please take note that no one is appointed into these offices (apostle, pastor, evangelist, teacher or prophet) due to being mature in the Lord. Most are actually appointed into the fivefold ministry whilst they are still babies in Christ. Jeremiah for instance, was called before he was even formed in his mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:4-5). He got to know about his calling whilst he was still a youth. Jeremiah received the grace to be a prophet when he was young and had to grow in it (grace) and wisdom (the word of God). Jesus expects those He called into the fivefold ministry to grow in grace and the knowledge of Him (the Word of God). These are just the starting point in the work of growth.\nThose called into the fivefold ministry are expected to labour for Church growth. By Church growth I am not referring to just numbers, but the maturity of Church members. Every Church member is expected to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. This means that every Church member is expected to not only grow in grace and wisdom, but to engineer growth in others through discipleship.\nYou need grace for you to grow in both grace itself and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. No one has the ability to transform other people's lives through the gospel unless they have received the grace to do so. It is for this reason that the Lord Jesus empowers people with the grace to function in Ministry. Unless one receives the grace to impact other people's lives, and be willing to grow in that grace and the knowledge of the Word of God, they may not contribute meaningfully to the Church of Jesus Christ. Pause and think! Are you still growing in grace and wisdom? What impact are you having in other people's lives? Be a disciple of Jesus Christ through making disciples. Promote growth in others. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

This means that grace is sufficient for every situation we face. No matter how weak or inadequate we may feel, God's grace is more than enough to carry us through.\nIn Titus 2:11-12 (NLT), we read; 'For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people. And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God.' Grace not only saves us but also teaches us how to live godly lives in this present world. It empowers us to say no to sin and yes to righteousness.\nGrace is not a license to sin. Some people misunderstand grace and think it gives them the freedom to live however they want. But Romans 6:1-2 (NLT) clearly states; 'Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace? Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?' Grace empowers us to live holy lives, not to indulge in sin.\nIn Ephesians 2:8-9 (NLT), we are reminded; 'God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can’t take credit for this; it is a gift from God. Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.' Grace is a gift from God. We cannot earn it or deserve it. It is freely given to us through faith in Jesus Christ.\nI pray that you will grow in the knowledge of God's grace and allow it to transform your life.

In Ephesians 1:6-7 (NLT), we read; 'So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son. He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.' Grace is what brings us into a relationship with God. It is through grace that we are forgiven and accepted by God.\nIn Romans 8:32 (NLT), we are reminded; 'Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won’t he also give us everything else?' Grace is the proof of God's love for us. It is the assurance that He will provide everything we need.\nGrace is not just for the past; it is also for the present and the future. In 2 Corinthians 12:9 (NLT), the Lord says; 'Each time he said, ‘My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.’ So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me.' Grace is sufficient for every situation we face. It is the power of God working in us and through us.\nIn Titus 3:7 (NLT), we are told; 'Because of his grace he declared us righteous and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life.' Grace is the assurance of our salvation. It is the confidence we have in God's promises.\nI pray that you will grow in the knowledge of God's grace and allow it to transform your life. May you experience the sufficiency of His grace in every area of your life. May you live a life that reflects the power of His grace.

Ever considered why you were not immediately taken to heaven when you got born again? There is work for you here on earth. This work is centred on growth; not only yours, but that of others as well.\nEphesians 4:11-16 (TPT) sums it all. It reads; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers. And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ. These grace ministries will function until we all attain oneness in the faith, until we all experience the fullness of what it means to know the Son of God, and finally we become one perfect man with the full dimensions of spiritual maturity and fully developed in the abundance of Christ. And then our immaturity will end! And we will not be easily shaken by trouble, nor led astray by novel teachings or by the false doctrines of deceivers who teach clever lies. But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth. All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into Him, the anointed Head of His body, the church. For His 'body' has been formed in His image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.' Hallelujah! Are you experiencing growth? How are you contributing to the growth of the Church of Jesus Christ?\nSpiritual growth results from a deep craving or a strong desire for the sincere milk of the Word of God. And as you become mature in Christ you can also eat strong meat (Hebrews 5:12 KJV). Growing in Christ is characterised by an addiction to the pure milk of the Word of God. 'As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye may grow thereby' (1 Peter 2:2 KJV).\nThere is usually a tendency among those who think that they are mature in Christ to despise the sincere milk of the Word of God. Paul addressed this in 1 Thessalonians 5:20 (Amplified Bible) which reads, 'Do not spurn the gifts and utterances of the prophets [do not depreciate prophetic revelations nor despise inspired instruction or exhortation or warning].' Take note that it pleased God to use the 'foolishness of preaching to save' those who believe (1 Corinthians 1:21). In as much as should enjoy 'strong meat' (the deep teachings of the Word of God) as you mature in Christ, you should however continue craving for the sincere milk of the Word of God. Never despise the preached Word of God as well as prophesies. This year, resolve to desire the sincere milk of the Word so you can grow. Help others to grow as well! Do the work of Ministry."}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Apostle Peter concluded his warning concerning the end times by instructing Christians to grow in grace and in the knowledge of Jesus Christ, our Lord (2 Peter 3:18). In these end times, there are many things that have the potential to stop you from growing as a Christian. Concerning the times we live in, the Lord Jesus said; 'And many lying prophets will arise, deceiving multitudes and leading them away from the path of truth. There will be such an increase of sin and lawlessness that those whose hearts once burned with passion for God and others will grow cold.' (Matthew 24:11-12 TPT). Do you still love God and the saints? The only way to keep your love for God and the saints alive is through growing in grace and the knowledge of the Word (Jesus Christ; see John 1:1).\nIn Colossians 2:6-10 (TLB) we read; 'And now just as you trusted Christ to save you, trust him, too, for each day's problems; live in vital union with Him. Let your roots grow down into him and draw up nourishment from him. See that you go on growing in the Lord, and become strong and vigorous in the truth you were taught. Let your lives overflow with joy and thanksgiving for all he has done. [8] Don't let others spoil your faith and joy with their philosophies, their wrong and shallow answers built on men's thoughts and ideas, instead of on what Christ has said. [9] For in Christ there is all of God in a human body; [10] so you have everything when you have Christ, and you are filled with God through your union with Christ. He is the highest Ruler, with authority over every other power.' Hallelujah!\nIn these end times, you will surely experience terrible 'storms of life'. God expects you to pass through valleys of the shadow of death trusting Him that He is faithful to His Word! He will never leave you without help! It takes deeper convictions in God for you not to give up when your faith is tested the way gold is purified by the fire (1 Peter 1:7). Peter further encourages you to grow your roots deeper in Christ. Hallelujah! Just as plants draw nourishment from the soil through their roots, you draw your life-giving strength from Christ. Thus, for you to grow upwards, grow your roots deeper in Christ. Remember that Christ is your life (Colossians 3:4). When your roots get deeper in Christ, then you become assured that His grace will always be sufficient for you (2 Corinthians 12:9). 'May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord' (2 Peter 1:2 NLT). Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

You should not stop growing. It is very interesting to note that even the Lord Jesus Christ grew, not only in stature but also in wisdom and in favour with God and people. Jesus Christ as God didn't have to grow, but Jesus as a human being had to grow. In Luke 2:39-40 (TPT) we read; 'When Mary and Joseph had completed everything required of them by the law of Moses, they took Jesus and returned to their home in Nazareth in Galilee. The child grew more powerful in grace, for he was being filled with wisdom, and the favor of God was upon him.' Also in Luke 2:52 (TPT) we read; 'As Jesus grew, so did his wisdom and maturity. The favor of men increased upon his life, for he was loved greatly by God.' Hallelujah! Do not stop growing!'But continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory, now and forever! Amen.' (2 Peter 3:18 GNT). Grow in wisdom and in grace! In 1 Corinthians 1:23-24 (GNT) we read; 'As for us, we proclaim the crucified Christ, a message that is offensive to the Jews and nonsense to the Gentiles; but for those whom God has called, both Jews and Gentiles, this message is Christ, who is the power of God and the wisdom of God.' Jesus Christ is our wisdom. Thus, growing in wisdom means growing in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ.\nGrowing in both grace and wisdom has many advantages. For instance, in Psalm 84:4-7 (TPT) we read; 'What pleasure fills those who live every day in your temple, enjoying you as they worship in your presence! Pause in his presence. How enriched are they who find their strength in the Lord; within their hearts are the highways of holiness! Even when their paths wind through the dark valley of tears, they dig deep to find a pleasant pool where others find only pain. He gives to them a brook of blessing filled from the rain of an outpouring. They grow stronger and stronger with every step forward, and the God of all gods will appear before them in Zion.' Hallelujah! Enjoying being in the house of God is a sure way of growing in grace and wisdom. Grow your roots deeper in God! This will enable you to continue to stand when you face the storms of life. May you be refreshed where others find only pain! May you grow stronger and stronger as you continue to grow in grace and wisdom. Move from faith to faith! This is your season to grow and prosper! Grow! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

It was the fact that he did not just receive the grace of God, but he took advantage of it and grew in it. David did not live like the Old Testament people. He chose to be different. Through grace he became a man after God's heart (1 Samuel 13:14, Acts 13:22). It was not due to his righteousness or good deeds that he became this. He didn't strive to qualify to be a man after God's heart. Grace qualified him. When you embrace grace and grow in grace and wisdom (the word of God, Jesus Christ) you will become a man or woman after God's heart.\nIn Acts 13:22 NIrV we read, 'God removed him and made David their king. Here is God's witness about him. 'David, son of Jesse, is a man dear to my heart,' he said. 'David will do everything I want him to do.'' Hallelujah! The New Living Translation renders this verse as follows; 'But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, 'I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.' What does it mean to be a person after God's heart? It means one is dear to God's own heart; the one who gets God's attention, understands Him, is like God, or one that God identifies with. David is the only person God explicitly said, 'He's a man after my own heart' (1 Samuel 13:14). Interestingly, when God said this, David was still a herdboy of his father's flock, before he was anointed by Samuel and long before he became the king of Israel. Waal! Grace!\nIn Luke 6:1-5 (TPT) we read; 'One Sabbath day, Jesus and his disciples were walking through a field of ripe wheat. His disciples plucked some heads of grain and rubbed the husks off with their hands and ate it. This infuriated some of the Jewish religious leaders. They said to Jesus, 'Why are you allowing your disciples to harvest grain on the Sabbath day? Don't you know it's not permissible according to the law?' Jesus replied, 'Haven't you read the Scriptures? Haven't you read what King David did when he was hungry? He entered the sanctuary of God, took the bread of God's presence right off the sacred table, and shared it with his men. It was only lawful for the priests to eat the bread of God's presence. You need to know that the Son of Man is no slave to the Sabbath day, for I am master over the Sabbath.' Waal! This is the gospel. It makes you free! As already said earlier, David did not just receive the grace of God, he grew in it. Continue to grow in grace and wisdom! Don't allow people's judgements to derail you. Although you should reflect on people's comments and feedback, you should not allow any negative comments to derail you from pursuing God! Grace frees you from people's doctrines. David broke the Law of Moses by eating the bread that was reserved only for the priests. He also gave the same bread to his followers. Jesus commended David for his actions. David was a man after God's heart despite his shortcomings. God loves you! He values you! Take advantage of grace and become all you were created to be! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

Reaching the stage of maturity is the purpose of growing in grace and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. Growth is never a goal. It is a means through which maturity is attained. In other words, you have to grow in order for you to attain maturity.\nIn Ephesians 4:11-16 (TPT) we read; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers. And their calling is to nurture and prepare all the holy believers to do their own works of ministry, and as they do this they will enlarge and build up the body of Christ.

All our direction and ministries will flow from Christ and lead us deeper into him, the anointed Head of his body, the church. For his 'body' has been formed in his image and is closely joined together and constantly connected as one. And every member has been given divine gifts to contribute to the growth of all; and as these gifts operate effectively throughout the whole body, we are built up and made perfect in love.' Hallelujah!\nJesus appoints certain individuals and empower them with the grace to function in the offices of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Please take note that no one is appointed into these offices (apostle, pastor, evangelist, teacher or prophet) due to being mature in the Lord. Most are actually appointed into the fivefold ministry whilst they are still babies in Christ. Jeremiah for instance, was called before he was even formed in his mother's womb (Jeremiah 1:4-5). He got to know about his calling whilst he was still a youth. Jeremiah received the grace to be a prophet when he was young and had to grow in it (grace) and wisdom (the word of God). Jesus expects those He called into the fivefold ministry to grow in grace and the knowledge of Him (the Word of God). These are just the starting point in the work of growth.\nThose called into the fivefold ministry are expected to labour for Church growth. By Church growth I am not referring to just numbers, but the maturity of Church members. Every Church member is expected to be a disciple of Jesus Christ. This means that every Church member is expected to not only grow in grace and wisdom, but to engineer growth in others through discipleship.\nYou need grace for you to grow in both grace itself and in the knowledge of the Lord Jesus. No one has the ability to transform other people's lives through the gospel unless they have received the grace to do so. It is for this reason that the Lord Jesus empowers people with the grace to function in Ministry. Unless one receives the grace to impact other people's lives, and be willing to grow in that grace and the knowledge of the Word of God, they may not contribute meaningfully to the Church of Jesus Christ. Pause and think! Are you still growing in grace and wisdom? What impact are you having in other people's lives? Be a disciple of Jesus Christ through making disciples. Promote growth in others.

In Matthew 6:9-10 (NLT) Jesus says; 'Pray like this: Our Father in heaven, may Your name be kept holy. May Your Kingdom come soon. May Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.' What does it mean for God's will to be done on earth the way it is done in heaven? Life in heaven is characterised by worship (Revelation 4:8-11, Revelation 5:7-14). God should be worshipped on earth the way He is worshipped in heaven.\nLet us look at Ephesians 4:11-14 (TPT) again. It reads; 'And He has appointed some with grace to be apostles, and some with grace to be prophets, and some with grace to be evangelists, and some with grace to be pastors, and some with grace to be teachers.

Take note that the purpose of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers is to nurture and prepare the saints for them to fulfil their own callings (the work of Ministry). The work of Ministry is centred on the growth of the Body of Christ (the Church). The work of apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers should come to an end when the Church attains oneness in the faith. The Church should get to a point where all divisions disappear. God's plan is for Christians to grow to the point where they become one in faith. You should stop being proud of belonging to Higher Life Centre or any other Church organisation. Become a member of the Body of Christ. In other words, become a Christian. Grow up! Mature in Christ!\nThe New International Reader's Version renders Ephesians 4:13 as follows: 'That will continue until we all become one in the faith. We will also become one in the knowledge of God's Son. Then we will be grown up in the faith. We will receive everything that Christ has for us.' The fivefold ministry will continue up until we become one in the faith! God's will must be done in on earth the way it is in heaven! There are no apostles in heaven neither are there prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers. Rather, there are worshippers in heaven. Our aim as we do the work of Ministry is to raise worshippers who will worship the God in truth (the Word of God) and in spirit (through the Ministry of the Holy Spirit). Grow and mature as a Christian! Help others grow! Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

This verse encapsulates the essence of our Christian walk—growth. Growth is not optional; it is a command. It is the pathway to maturity and the means by which we fulfill our divine purpose.\nIn Ephesians 4:15-16 (TPT), we read; 'But instead we will remain strong and always sincere in our love as we express the truth.

This verse reminds us that growth is a divine work. It is God who initiates it, and it is He who will bring it to completion. Our role is to cooperate with Him in this process.\nIn 1 Corinthians 3:6-7 (NLT), we read; 'I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow. It’s not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What’s important is that God makes the seed grow.' Hallelujah! Growth is ultimately God's work. He is the one who causes the seed of His Word to grow in our hearts. However, this does not mean that we are passive in this process. We have a responsibility to prepare our hearts to receive the Word and to guard it diligently (Proverbs 4:23).\nIn Luke 8:15 (NLT), Jesus explains the Parable of the Sower by saying; 'And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God’s word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.'

Growth that impacts others and brings glory to God.\nAs you continue on this journey of growth, remember that it is a journey of faith. In Hebrews 11:6 (NLT), we are reminded that 'it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.' Growth requires faith. It requires a sincere seeking of God. It requires a heart that is willing to trust Him even when the journey seems long and difficult.\nI pray that you will continue to grow in faith, in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. May your life be a reflection of His glory. May you produce a harvest that brings joy to the heart of God. May you grow and help others grow. Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}

(11)","slug":{"current":"growth-11"},"date":"2025-03-17","content":[{"_type":"block","style":"normal","children":[{"_type":"span","text":"In as much as a sower (pastor, evangelist, teacher, prophet or apostle) has the responsibility of sowing the Word into your heart, you have the responsibility of preparing your heart to receive it, and also for diligently guarding your heart (Proverbs 4:23). Fellow saints, on the other hand, have the responsibility of watering the Word of God sown in your heart through encouraging you. When your faith is being tested, you need fellow believers to encourage you to soldier on. Christians should always gather for the purpose of watering each other. In Hebrews 10:24-25 (TPT), we are instructed; 'Discover creative ways to encourage others and to motivate them toward acts of compassion, doing beautiful works as expressions of love. This is not the time to pull away and neglect meeting together, as some have formed the habit of doing. In fact, we should come together even more frequently, eager to encourage and urge each other onward as we anticipate that day dawning.' Thus, there is a need for the saints to come up with creative ways of encouraging and motivating each other.\nGod's responsibility is to cause the Word sown in your heart to produce a lifestyle of the miraculous for you. Many professing Christians make the mistake of leaving everything up to God. In Jeremiah 4:3 (TLB) we read; 'The Lord is saying to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Plow up the hardness of your hearts; otherwise the good seed will be wasted among the thorns.' Develop the habit of preparing yourself for church meetings. During praise and worship, prepare your heart to receive the Word of God.\nIn the Parable of the Sower, we read; 'Other seeds fell where there was nothing but weeds. They too were unable to grow to full maturity, for the weeds choked them out.' (Luke 8:7 TPT). Take note that it was neither God's fault nor was it that of the sower that the good seed fell among thorns or weeds. In Luke 8:14 (NLT) we read; 'The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity.' Do not allow anything to do with life on earth (good or bad) to stunt your growth as a Christian.\nI pray for God to 'give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord' (2 Peter 1:2 NLT). 'And I am sure that God who began the good work within you will keep right on helping you grow in His grace until His task within you is finally finished on that day when Jesus Christ returns' (Philippians 1:6 TLB). 'I pray that you will continually experience the immeasurable greatness of God’s power made available to you through faith. Then your lives (life) will be an advertisement of this immense power as it works through you!' (Ephesians 1:19 TPT). Hallelujah!"}]}],"author":{"_type":"reference","_ref":"3fb8e6af-8f4f-4b62-b336-572007446e3a"}}
